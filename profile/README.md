# VerdeHarvest: Harnessing the Power of Connectivity.

Welcome to the VerdeHarvest GitHub organization! VerdeHarvest is a transformative platform dedicated to revolutionizing agriculture by connecting farmers, suppliers, and buyers. This repository serves as the central hub for VerdeHarvest's source code and development history.

## Structure
The repositories are as follows:

- verdeharvest-backend/: This repository contains the backend code of VerdeHarvest, featuring API endpoints, database models, and business logic, all implemented in NodeJS using the express framework.

- verdeharvest-frontend/: In this repository, you'll find the frontend code for VerdeHarvest, developed using JavaScript, React, and Redux. This directory encompasses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files responsible for creating the user interface.

- verdeharvest-models/: The models repository hosts the potent Generative AI models harnessed by VerdeHarvest to augment the platform's capabilities. These models, constructed using Python-based AI/ML libraries, play a pivotal role in addressing specific challenges within the agricultural domain.

## Purpose
This repository is a collaborative space designed to advance and refine VerdeHarvest. By granting public access, our goal is to encourage community involvement, enabling developers, contributors, and users to delve into the codebase, report issues, and propose enhancements. Together, we aim to transform agriculture and bridge the gap between rural farming and the wider market.

## How Connectivity Transforms Agriculture
VerdeHarvest capitalizes on the power of connectivity to revolutionize agriculture. Our platform seamlessly connects farmers in rural areas with suppliers and buyers, enhancing accessibility to agricultural produce. Through VerdeHarvest, we're breaking down barriers, reducing surplus produce, and empowering farming communities.

By establishing these connections, VerdeHarvest ensures that farmers can easily list their produce, while suppliers and buyers can efficiently source quality agricultural goods. Our platform simplifies transactions, streamlines pricing, and provides real-time market insights, ultimately driving growth and prosperity in agriculture. Together, we're reshaping the agricultural landscape, one connection at a time.


## How Generative AI Models Enhance VerdeHarvest
At VerdeHarvest, we harness the potential of cutting-edge Generative AI models to elevate specific features and solve intricate challenges. Our commitment to innovation is reflected in the way these AI models seamlessly integrate into the platform to provide unparalleled solutions:

- <b>Dynamic Pricing:</b> Our Generative AI models are at the heart of our dynamic pricing feature. By analyzing real-time market data, supply-demand trends, and various factors affecting pricing, these models recommend optimal prices for agricultural produce. This not only encourages fair pricing but also reduces surplus produce due to price mismatches, benefiting both sellers and buyers.

- <b>Demand Forecasting:</b> VerdeHarvest relies on advanced AI algorithms to forecast demand for specific agricultural products in various markets. These models analyze historical data, market trends, and external factors to provide farmers with valuable insights. Armed with this information, farmers can make informed decisions about what to plant, thus reducing overproduction and minimizing waste.

- <b>Visual Question Answering (VQA):</b> Our Generative AI models, including the dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa model, are fine-tuned to address visual question answering (VQA) challenges. When users have questions about agricultural resources that involve visual content, such as images of crops or equipment, our AI models step in. They can accurately interpret these images and provide meaningful responses, enriching the learning experience and facilitating better communication between users.

By incorporating these AI-driven features, VerdeHarvest empowers users to make data-driven decisions, enhance their understanding of agricultural resources, and streamline their interactions within the platform. Our Generative AI models play a pivotal role in ensuring that VerdeHarvest remains at the forefront of agricultural innovation, delivering value to farmers, suppliers, and buyers alike.
